Developers use HTML and CSS to control the content and styling of a page. And they use JavaScript to make that page interactive.

In this JavaScript Algorithm and Data Structures Repo, I'll learn the JavaScript fundamentals like variables, arrays, objects, loops, functions, the DOM and more.

I'll also learn about Object Oriented Programming (OOP), Functional Programming, algorithmic thinking, how to work with local storage, and how to fetch data using an API.
