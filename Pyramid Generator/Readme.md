### Javascript String:
JavaScript has **seven primitive data types**, with String being one of them. 
- In JavaScript, a string represents a sequence of characters and can be enclosed in either single (`'`) or double (`"`) quotes.
- Note that strings are immutable, which means once they are created, they cannot be changed. The variable can still be reassigned another value.
- strings are case-sensitive.

### Variables Declaration & Initialization
- When you declare a variable without initializing it, it is considered `uninitialized`.
- The default value of an uninitialized variable is `undefined`. This is a special data type that represents a value that does not have a definition yet.

### Array
- An array is a non-primitive data type that can hold a series of values. Non-primitive data types differ from primitive data types in that they can hold more complex data. 
- Primitive data types like strings and numbers can only hold one value at a time.
- Arrays are denoted using square brackets (`[]`).
- `push()` -> returns the new length of the array, after adding the value you give it.
- `pop()` -> returns the value that was removed from the end of the array.
